# Production Code Audit

For read-only audits (report without fixing), prefer the `code-reviewer` agent instead.

Scan the entire codebase autonomously, identify all issues, fix them, and report results. Do all of this without asking the user for input.

## Step 1: Codebase Discovery

Read every source file. Identify:
- Tech stack (languages, frameworks, databases, tools)
- Architecture (structure, patterns, dependencies)
- Entry points and data flow

## Step 2: Issue Detection

Scan line-by-line for:

**Architecture:** Circular dependencies, tight coupling, god classes (>500 lines / >20 methods), poor module boundaries

**Security:** SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, missing auth/authz, weak password hashing (MD5/SHA1), missing input validation, CSRF, insecure dependencies

**Performance:** N+1 queries, missing DB indexes, missing caching, inefficient algorithms (O(n²)+), unoptimized assets, memory leaks

**Code quality:** High cyclomatic complexity (>10), duplication, magic numbers, poor naming, dead code, TODO/FIXME

**Testing:** Missing critical path tests, coverage <80%, no edge cases, flaky tests

**Production readiness:** Missing env vars, no logging/monitoring/error tracking, no health checks

## Step 3: Fix Everything

1. Refactor architecture (break up god classes, fix circular deps)
2. Fix security issues (parameterized queries, remove secrets, add validation)
3. Optimize performance (fix N+1, add caching, optimize algorithms)
4. Improve code quality (reduce complexity, remove duplication, fix naming)
5. Add missing tests for critical paths
6. Add production infrastructure (logging, monitoring, health checks)

## Step 4: Verify and Report

1. Run all tests
2. Measure before/after improvements
3. Report findings with grades per category (A-F)
