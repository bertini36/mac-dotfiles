# Feature Development Workflow

> Directives live in `CLAUDE.md`. This file is the walkthrough.

Step-by-step guide for building features using the Claude Code configuration in this repo.

## 1. Start a worktree

Open a Claude console in an isolated worktree:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --worktree
```

This creates an isolated copy of the repo so your work doesn't interfere with the main branch.

## 2. Brainstorm

Describe what you want to build. The `superpowers:brainstorming` skill triggers automatically to explore requirements, edge cases, and design before any code is written.

## 3. Plan

The `superpowers:writing-plans` skill creates a step-by-step implementation plan. The `evaluator` agent then scores it on seven criteria (correctness, completeness, simplicity, consistency, testability, security, reversibility) and issues a GO/NO-GO verdict. Implementation only proceeds on GO.

## 4. Implement

The `superpowers:executing-plans` skill drives implementation with review checkpoints. For independent tasks, `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` runs multiple agents in parallel.

Domain-specific rules load automatically based on the files you touch:

| File pattern | Rule loaded | Skill available |
|---|---|---|
| `**/*.py` | `python` | `python-code-style` |
| Django files (views, models, urls, admin, etc.) | `django` | `django-patterns` |
| LangChain/LangGraph files | `langchain` | `langchain-architecture` |
| Test files | `tests` | - |

## 5. Verify

The `superpowers:verification-before-completion` skill runs before any success claim. Additionally, CLAUDE.md requires running three skills before marking a task complete:

- `production-code-audit`
- `django-patterns`
- `python-code-style`

## 6. Review

Review your branch changes:

```
/review
```

This dispatches the `code-reviewer` agent on the diff against `main`.

For a full audit including security:

```
/audit
```

This dispatches both the `code-reviewer` and `security-reviewer` agents.

## 7. Create PR

```
/create-pull-request
```

Uses the `create-pull-request` skill with `writing-clearly-and-concisely` for the description. The `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` skill guides the merge/PR decision.

## Quick Reference

```
Brainstorm  -->  Plan  -->  Evaluate  -->  Implement  -->  Verify  -->  Review  -->  PR
```

Most steps trigger automatically through the `superpowers` plugin. The manual touchpoints are:

- `/review` to run code review
- `/audit` to run full audit
- `/create-pull-request` to open the PR

## Fixing Issues

To pick up a GitHub issue and fix it directly:

```
/fix-issue 42
```

Fetches the issue, implements the fix, runs tests and pre-commit hooks, and creates a conventional commit referencing the issue.
